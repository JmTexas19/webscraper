To Be a Power in the Shadows! Chapter 1-5
I don't remember what was the trigger. All I know is that ever since I can remember, I've always yearned after "powers in the shadows."Was it because of anime? Manga? Or movies? Actually, it doesn't really matter. As long as it was a power in the shadows, it didn't matter what it was, I loved it.Not the hero. Nor the last boss. I'm talking about those existences that work their interference and flex their true strength only from the shadows.I adored them, and wanted to be one of them.What heroes were to everyone else was what powers in shadows were to me. That's all that was.But unlike those children who adored heroes, mine was not a short-lived passion. It  was something much deeper, something that burned from the depths of my heart, and it continuously propelled me forward.Karate. Boxing. Kendo. Mixed martial arts. And more. To become strong, I threw myself into learning everything I would need, all while hiding my strength. For the sake of the day when I would get to reveal myself.At school, I was mediocrity itself. Harmless to man and beast, one and all. Mob character A.But on the flip side of my everyday life was grueling training.That was my youth, and that was my school life.But as time passed and I grew older, unease pressed upon me. It became time to face reality.The reality that all my effort was meaningless.No matter how many martial arts I master, I would still be far from the overwhelming power possessed by those powers hidden in shadows depicted in stories.The most I could achieve would be the strength to beat up a few punks. If firearms came into the picture, things would get tough. And if I got surrounded by soldiers wearing full equipment, well then, that'd be game over.Power in the shadows that gets beaten up by soldiers. How laughable.Even if I spent several more decades in training, even if I became the world's strongest martial artist, if I got surrounded by soldiers, I'd still get beaten up. Mm, or maybe I would be able to handle it somehow. Perhaps, with enough training, humans might possess the potential to beat up soldiers even if originally surrounded.However, even if I could beat down every single soldier, if a taepodong fell on my head, I'd get evaporated. That is the limit of being a human.(T/N: ‘Taepodong’ is a North Korean ICBM.)This alone I could say with utmost certainty. The power in shadows that I adored would not get evaporated by a mere taepodong. Which means that I, too, had to become a human who wouldn't be evaporated by a taepodong.What is it that I needed such that a taepodong wouldn't be able to evaporate me?Punching power?A sturdy body?Endless stamina?Of course not.I would need something different, an altogether different kind of strength.Magic, mana, qi, aura, anything was fine. I would need to acquire a mystical power of some sort.And that was the answer that I had arrived at, after facing reality.If there was someone searching for real magic, I'm sure everyone would doubt that person's sanity.So would I. Of course he's insane.But, well, how is it really?In this world, no one has yet been able to proof the existence of magic. But on the flip side, neither has anyone been able to disproof, with utter certainty, that magic does not exist.Sanity would not grant me the strength that I sought. It for sure is something that lies beyond the realm of insanity.From that point on, my training became much more difficult.Magic. Mana. Qi. Aura. No one knew how to learn any of these.I meditated Buddhist-style, I meditated under waterfalls, I meditated quietly, I fasted, I mastered yoga, I converted, I searched for spirits, I prayed, I even affixed myself to a cross.There was no correct answer. My only option was to keep going down the path that I believed in, all alone in the darkness.With the passage of time, I finally approached the last summer of my high school era.I still had yet to find magic or mana or qi or aura……◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇After finishing the usual training, I realize that the sky has become completely dark.I put on the underwear that I'd dropped next to me before threading my arms through my school uniform.I still had yet to grasp a mystical power. However, I feel like I'm making some progress in my recent training.Such as right now.Having just finished a training session, there is a bright light flickering on and off inside my head, and my vision is wobbling unsteadily.Either magic…… or perhaps aura……I am definitely feeling the effects of either one of those.I can say that today's training was meaningful indeed.By taking off all my clothes while in the forest, I was able to feel myself becoming one with nature. By continuously banging my head against a thick tree trunk, I was able to purge my mind of distracting thoughts AND stimulate my brain to encourage it to awaken to mystical powers.It is a perfectly logical training menu.Aah, my vision is blurring over.It's almost as if I'm suffering from a cerebral concussion.With floating steps – it's as if I'm almost floating through the air! – I come down from the forest.Abruptly, I see a swaying light.Two lights actually, swerving through midair.How mysterious they are! They seem to be guiding me, inviting me."C-, could it be…… magic?"I approach with tottering steps.It must be! It's magic!Finally! I have finally found a mystical power!Before I knew it, my steps have turned into a dash. There are tree roots in my way, but even when I trip I continue rolling towards the lights, simply plunging forward like a wild animal."Magic! Magic! Magic! Magicmagicmagicmagicmagic!!!"I jump out before the two lights, and grab……"Ah……?"The headlights dye my world pure white.The sound of screeching brakes reverberate inside my head.The shock penetrates my body, and I…… my…… magic…………◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇In conclusion, I did find magic.When I woke up, my surroundings was filled with magic. It's a bit different from those two lights that I saw at the end, but hey, who cares about the insignificant details.Oh right, and another insignificant detail is that I apparently reincarnated. Perhaps it was because I found magic that the gate of reincarnation opened for me. Or whatever. Again, who cares.At the moment, I am a baby of several months. It was only recently that I came to be fully aware, and my sense of time is still a bit blurry, so I'm not sure of the exact details.Above anything else, I don't understand the language. All I do know is that this world has a medieval European-like culture, which, well, I suppose is good enough.Because what actually does matter is that I have finally gotten my hands on magic.That is the be all and end all. The process and other extra details are of no interest to me.As soon as I'd come to, I had noticed the magic. The sight of those glittering particles floating around in the air is exactly like what I had felt while running through a field of flowers buck naked as part of my training in my previous life.That training was by no means pointless. The proof of that is the fact that I'd immediately been able to sense magic, and that now I've become as proficient with it as with my own hands and legs. This feeling is just like that time when I had affixed myself to a cross while buck naked…… no, it is like when I had repeatedly converted religions and danced in prayer while buck naked…… I'm sure every bit of my training is now bearing fruit.I've already confirmed that physical strengthening is indeed possible.Pouring all the free time that a baby is blessed with into training, this time for sure I will become a power in the shadows…… ah, gonna poop.Speaking of which, I'd learned somewhere that birds are incontinent, but so are human babies. No matter how much my reasoning tells me to resist, my instinct screams at me to let it out. However, with the physical strengthening that I had spent days and nights training up, I constrict my anal sphincter to buy time, during which….."GYAaaaaaAAAA!"…… I call for help.I think about 10 years has gone by.Magic is amazing. With it, I can easily make movements far beyond human limits.Crushing rocks? Easy.Running twice the speed of a horse? Totally.Jumping higher than houses? You bet.But I'm afraid a taepodong is still beyond me. Magic can up my physical resistance, but mighty are Earth's weapons.The thought that "There is no taepodong in this world, so isn't it fine to drop this?" did cross my mind, but what worth is there in a power in the shadows who attained his position by compromising?None, absolutely zero.Thus, I continue to strive towards attaining a body that can win over a taepodong.To that aim, I have poured my days into research and training. Recently, a certain possibility has surfaced in my mind, and I'm currently experimenting on it.Oh and by the way, the family that I was born into is apparently a noble house. It's a lineage that has continuously spat out knights that fight while using magic to strengthen themselves – so-called magic swordsmen. And I was brought up as the family's heir with sky high expectations and respect…… or not. Nah, they just treated me like any other apprentice swordsman.Powers in shadows reveal their true strength only to people and in places of their choosing. Up till that moment……Though I am holding back, the training for apprentice swordsmen is not completely useless to me. I am able to learn how this world fights with magic, and it is also a chance for me to review my own fighting style.To be blunt, the fighting techniques that I had learned in my previous life are several folds more polished and rational.This could be easily seen just by watching any modern martial arts match. Useless techniques and unnecessary movements have all been weeded out, and different schools have taken and adopted other schools' very best. That melting pot effect was indeed bringing all those schools towards the path of being perfected.Of course, modern martial arts have boundaries called 'rules,' but that does not change the fact that their various techniques are being polished against each other and undergoing the process of selection.But this world, in comparison. Firstly, there is absolutely no way that a technique crosses between countries. Neither would a technique cross schools. There are techniques that apparently only disciples can learn and are forbidden from leaving the school grounds. Even if a technique gets publicized, there is no media to spread it. In other words, there is no melting pot, no selection, no polishing. If I had to sum them up in a single word, it would be "crude."But this world's fighting is indeed fundamentally different from that of my previous world. Exactly, because of magic.Due to magic, basic physical stats of this world's people are on a totally different level.For example, physical strength. People can lift someone else up with a single hand. Just because of that, all grappling techniques become obsolete. Even if I mount someone, they can jump into the sky just by flexing their abdominal muscles. Even if I put someone into the guard position, they can send me flying with just a single leg. So yea, grappling techniques, all out the window.People fight the way that people fight, and goblins fight the way that goblins fight. That's all there is to that.Furthermore, the speed and distance of step ins are different, so maai are considered differently.And actually, this is the most important one.(T/N: 'Maai' refers to the space between two opponents in combat; formally, the “engagement distance”. It is a complex concept, incorporating not just the distance between opponents, but also the time it will take to cross the distance, angle and rhythm of attack. It is specifically the exact position from which one opponent can strike the other, after factoring in the above elements. For example, a faster opponent’s maai is farther away than a slower opponent. ~Wikipedia)Martial arts are, in essence, a fight over maai. Distance, angle, positioning, these are all what the fights are all about.It took me quite some time to determine my own maai in this world. I mean, this world's people's maai are so far away. They start fights standing 5m away from each other. Sure, their step in is long, and their speed is fast, so it's not like I don't understand. At first, I was impressed with it and thought "ohh so this is this world's fighting style"…… but nah, turns out that it's only because their defense techniques are undeveloped.We have this kind of people in our world too – people who suck at defense so they just meaninglessly distance themselves from their opponent as much as possible.The opponent's attack is scary, isn't it? Being in a place where their attacks can't reach you is safer, isn't it? So that's why fights become just blandless repetitions of opponents dashing in to make an attack before dashing right back out. Hit and run, is it? Sorry, useless and simple back and forth movements don't count as hit and run.To me, 5m and 100m is equally worthless. After all, proper attacks can't be launched from either distance. 6m, 7m, 10m, it's all the same. There's no point to it, so let's just walk closer together and close the distance, shall we?But at a certain distance, there is enormous meaning between the difference of 1mm, which is maai. Whether my attacks will hit, whether my opponent can react in time, considering the angle and various other things, gaining or losing advantage by moving half a step sideways or tilting a certain degree. By no means is it just running 5m to make an attack before jumping backwards 6m.All my preconceptions about another world and magic and all that confused me for quite a while, but recently I was finally able to determine my own maai, so all's good, I suppose.So yea, that's pretty much how my daily training at home goes. There's only me, my older sister, and my dad – my dad teaches my older sister and me, and my older sister and I spar. My older sister of 2 years above seems to have quite the talent, and will most likely become the heir of the house. In this world where magic can be used, even girls can become crazy strong, so girls becoming the heads of their families is not that uncommon.And because of that, I get beaten up by my sister pretty much every day. I mean, I can't win, right? After all, to become a power in the shadows, I have to act out my common life as an unremarkable Mob A.Which is why I spend everyday going "fueee, onee-chan you're so strong~" while getting beaten up.◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇So, such is my daily life. During the daytime, I also have studies related to being a noble, as well as various other tasks that I need to carry out as Mob A, so I don't have much free time.Therefore, my personal training naturally ends up having to be carried out at night, after everyone else has gone to sleep. Of course, that means decreasing my sleeping hours, but by combining the effects of meditation and magic's recovery powers, I was able to develop a unique sleeping style that is super short but super effective.Well then, let's work hard at training today as well. For today, I have a bit of a special menu after the usual running in the forest.As of late, it seems that some ruffians have taken to occupying a nearby abandoned village. Upon investigation, they turned out to be a bandit gang of quite some size. Yep, they make for perfect tameshikiri targets.(T/N: A sort of urban legend is that there were swordsmen in the Edo period who would test out new swords by cutting up random pedestrians on the streets, and this act was called tameshikiri.)I do kill random scattered brigands whenever I come across them, but something the level of a full-fledged bandit gang is like a once in a year event for me, so I'm quite excited. All year long I'm in lack of a proper sparring partner, so I love these kinds of criminals. Aah, can the local public order go down please?In the rural areas of this world, criminals can generally be killed without a trial. More like, only the large cities have judges, so those in the rural areas aren't too fussed up about this kind of thing. Which is why I will judge you all, kekeke.Today is to commemorate a new weapon that I have recently been trying out – the slime bodysuit.Allow me to explain what the slime bodysuit is.This world has magic. This world's people fight by using that magic to strengthen themselves and their weapons. However, there is always some degree of loss when they use magic. For example, a normal iron sword would only have 10% efficiency – you pour in 100 points of magic, but the effect is only a boost of 10 points. Which means that 90% of the magic is lost in the process. Even for mithril, a metal lauded for its high conductivity, a sword capable of 50% efficiency would already be considered to be a high grade item. So in short, there is always a huge amount of loss.Then I came to consider slimes. Slimes are, well, true to their appearances, magical beings. They change form and move around using only magic. When I studied them further, I realized that their magical conductivity is a mind-shattering 99%. Furthermore, as they are in liquid form, they can freely change form. So I hunted slimes, crushed their cores, and experimented on the leftover slime jelly. The number of slime cores that I have crushed are easily in the thousands. It was to the degree where the local area began suffering from a slime deficiency, forcing me to go on expeditions further afield.The slime jelly was quite easy to process. After strengthening and compounding it, I was eventually able to make a full-body bodysuit out of it. Unlike armor, it does not make any sound, is comfortable, and actually even provides support to any movements I make. And of course, its defensive capabilities are also guaranteed.At the moment, I'm wearing a completely black bodysuit made from slime jelly mixed with black pigments. There is no unnecessary adornments, the suit fits my body perfectly, and my vision and breathing is unobstructed. I pretty much look exactly like the villains in a certain detective manga.Perhaps I should also think of a more appropriate design in preparation for the day when I shall intervene as a power from the shadows.◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇◆◇So with that, I've arrived at the abandoned village. Despite the late hour, they've got torches lit up all over the place. Apparently, they've just successfully assaulted a merchant caravan, so now they're having a feast. Yep, my luck is pretty good. Bandits generally have zero planning skills, so they have a strong tendency to immediately use up whatever they get their hands on. It's only right after an assault that they actually have things worth anything.What belongs to the bandits, belongs to me. This is how I'm saving up capital for becoming a power in the shadows in the future.With max tension, I crash into the feast. I don't play the stealth route, because then that wouldn't count as practice."Hyaha~! Bring out all your money and valuables!!"So I yelled standing smack dab in the middle of the camp."The fuck is with this little squirt?"I'm 10 years old, so I guess the 'little squirt' comment is not entirely undue."Oraa, I said to bring out all your money!"After I kick away the rude guy who called me a squirt, the other bandits finally take up their weapons."Oi, if you look down on us too much don't think we'll go easy on you just 'cus you're a……!""Oraa!"That guy's lines were just too cliche that I couldn't help but to cut off his head first. Naturally, my weapon is made of slime material; it's an exceptional weapon that I can take out only when needed. Furthermore, this slime sword still has several more handy functions.Handy Function 1: it stretches."Ora ora ora ora oraaaAAA!"I stretch the slime sword and swing it in a horizontal arc to take out all the nearby bandits.The elasticity of mochi paired with the sharpness of an actual sword. It's the first time I'm using it in real combat so I had been slightly apprehensive, but turns out it performs quite well."ORA ORA ORA ORAAA…… hmm?"After getting caught up in the moment and cutting every which way indiscriminately, I suddenly realize that the surroundings has become really quiet. Eh, there's only one guy left?"Y-, you, who the hell are you……?""Sigh, no other choice. I'll test Handy Function 2 on you then.""Wha-, what are you saying……!?""It seems that you're a bit stronger than all those other guys, so you're probably the boss or something, yea? Unfortunately, there is zero possibility for you to win against me, but if you agree to be my practice partner than you can probably live for 2 more minutes. Try your best, alright?""Fuck you, making light of me! I'll have you know, I'm……!""Unnecessary comments are unnecessary, seriously.""FUCK YOU!!!!!!"Boss A charges at me in rage. In the face of that dull slash, I…… choose not to evade.So Boss A's sword smashes into my chest, the shock causing me to roll onto the ground."Haha, this is what happens when you make light of me! I have completely mastered Royal Capital Bushin Style…… wha-, WHAT?!""Hmm, not even a scratch."I stand back up as if nothing had happened.I am completely satisfied with the suit's defense capabilities. Seems like it can completely negate at least something on the level of Boss A's attacks."Ooo, Royal Capital Bushin Style? Isn't it the school that has been pretty popular in the royal capital of late? Hey, show me more!""Shit, you asked for it!"Boss A attacks.Er, um, yea, easy. He's giving his very best in trying to cut me, but I don't even have to hold up my sword. Just with positioning and stepping alone, handling him is easy-peasy.But this Bushin Style? I think I quite like it.Uncommonly so for this world, I can see that this style is not one bound by idealism or trite traditions, but takes direct and rational ways to close in to the opponent. I can recognize that even from Boss A's crappy swings. Instantaneous acceleration, pressing forward by half steps, and the variety of other methods to press towards the opponent resonates with me.But, well, Boss A is really just too crappy at it.The moment when Boss A's attacks let up, I easily step out of his maai."My, my sword…… why didn't you get cut!""I mean, you're weaker than my dad. You're probably stronger than my older sister at the moment, but she'll probably overtake you in one more year or so I think?""YOU GODDAMN BRAT!!!!"After parrying Boss A's reckless swings, I lightly kick his shin. Light, but snappy, it was a kick from below the knee.At which……"Gu, aa, why……?"Boss A crumples into a kneel, pressing down on his shin. Red blood gurgles through his fingers and makes a stain on the ground.What happened was simple; there is an ice pick-like sword extending from my toes. Slime bodysuit Handy Function 2: able to to extend a sword whenever and wherever I want.The way I thought to use this function is to kick the opponent's leg with a sword extending from my toes. It is really hard to defend against an attack aimed at the legs. Block the opponent's sword with my own, seal their movements, then kick their leg. Bland, but effective."Guess there's no point keeping up with this any longer.""W-, wait!""You didn't even last the full 2 minutes, man."I kick upwards with the sword from my toes, skewering Boss A's head from under his chin. Death by impalement.Kicking away Boss A's convulsing body, I search the camp for loot."I don't know a fence who can handle these works of art…… eh, foodstuffs I don't need either…… come on, where are you, cash and jewels and precious metals~"There were several carts of loot. And also several corpses of merchants."I've already helped you guys take revenge, and your goods will be used for a good cause, so rest in peace, alright?"I gathered the passable quality of loot and offered a moment of silence. If I convert all this to cash, I guess it'll be about 5 million Zeny. Oh, 1 Zeny is about the same value as 1 yen. All of this will become the funding for my activities as a power in the shadows.If only the entire world could have worse public order such that it would overflow with bandits. Maybe to the level in games, where you can encounter one just by walking several steps on the road."Work harder in your next life and become the bandit king, alright?"So I say to the silent Boss A…… before noticing something further beyond."Cage……?"It's a pretty big and sturdy-looking one too."Slave? I can't fence that, so pass~"But maybe, just maybe, there's something good in there. So just in case, I remove the tarp covering the cage."This…… I did not expect."Inside is, um, how to say…… a rotten lump of flesh? I can just barely make out the humanoid shape, but can't discern the gender nor age nor anything else.But well, it's still living. Maybe it still even has consciousness. When I peered into the cage, I noticed the lump of meat twitching.I've heard of this before. It's called demon possession, and the Church executes these monsters. They were originally born as normal humans, but one day their body suddenly begins to rot away. They would eventually die if left alone, but the Church proactively buys them and executes them in the name of purification. This purification of demons is pretty much just genocide of patients, but the Church gains acclamation from the populace for "protecting" the common populace from the "demons." What can I say, it's medieval Europe indeed.If I sell this lump of meat to the Church, it'll fetch a price higher than the combined worth of everything I looted today. But again, I can't actually go sell it, so there's no meaning to it.Guess I'll at least just put it to rest.I slide the slime sword in between the bars of the cage…… but then suddenly realize something.There is an enormous amount of magic inside this lump of meat. Even though I've been training my magic ever since I was a baby, the amount I have still pales in comparison. What a monstrous amount of magic. And furthermore……"This wave…… is it magic deviation……?"Is it possibly the case that the reason why this lump of meat became like this is due to magic deviation? Previously, I had also suffered from magic deviation. If I hadn't successfully brought my magic back under control that time, would I have also become like this?Magic has an undeniable effect on the physical body. A certain day, I thought of a certain possibility. Would it be possible that through magic deviation, I can train my body to become further accustomed to magic, such that it can become easier for me to control magic? But purposely causing magic deviation is too dangerous, so in the end I had shelved the idea.But if this lump of meat is truly the product of magic deviation, and if I can perform my experiments on this lump of meat…… then I can get even closer to the strength of a power in the shadows with zero risk to myself."This meat, can be of use……"I reach out to the lump of meat, and begin to pour magic into it.It's been almost a month, I guess.While thinking of the day I got my hands on that lump of meat, I sigh deeply while standing in that same abandoned village.How did things become like this.The experimentation on the lump of meat went well until around halfway through. Since it was not my own body, I had no qualms about pouring in tons and tons of magic. Not this, not that, maybe this way, maybe that way, oh I just had tons of fun with the experiments day after day. Damn it was fun. I got closer to the essence of magic, and felt my own strength growing at a visible rate. Everything was good.I improved on my magic control, making it denser, finer, and stronger, until the moment came that I was able to completely suppress the magic deviation…… then suddenly I found a young blond elf girl in front of my eyes.I was too absorbed in controlling my magic that I didn't notice the lump of meat turning into a blond elf until that moment. It's pretty amazing, being able to return from being that lump of meat. So I pretty much decided to send her off like "You're free now, so return to your home!" or "May you be happy in the future!" But then she was like "I can no longer to home" and like "I must return this debt of gratitude." I mean, seriously, I wasn't helping you, you're just a coincidental outcome, alright?It seemed like a pain, and I considered just running away, but in the end I agreed to have her become my very first subordinate as a power in the shadows. Doesn't seem like she'll betray me, and she seems pretty smart, and kind of possesses an unnecessarily capable aura. Even though her age is 10 just like me, but apparently the rumor that elves mature mentally much faster wasn't a lie."Which is why, from today onwards, your name will be Alpha."α, Alpha, either way is fine."I understand."She nodded. Blond hair, blue eyes, white skin, outstanding beauty, she's very much the stereotypical elf."And as for your duties……"I stop talking and take a moment to think. This part is important.Her job is to support me as a power in the shadows, that's for sure. But then I'd have to clarify exactly what a power in the shadows means, and what my actual aim is. In other words, I have to tell her the fundamentals of my role in this world as a power in the shadows.The setting of any plot is important. If the reason for fighting is "because I got pissed after losing at pachinko" then that'll just be dumb.In that area, I am thoroughly prepared. Before coming to this world, and certainly after coming to this world, I've continuously dreamt of my best idea of being a power in the shadows.Combining together the several thousands, several tens of thousands of patterns that I had thought up previously, I instantaneously arrived at the optimum scenario."From the shadows, we shall interfere with, and stop, the resurrection of the demon Diabolos.""The demon Diabolos……?"Alpha tilts her head in puzzlement."I'm sure you already know that in distant history, the demon Diabolos had almost completely destroyed the entire world. However, three heroes – one an elf, one a beast person, and one a human – stood up and defeated Diabolos, thus saving the world.""I've also heard that before, but isn't that just a fairytale?""No, it actually happened. Though the truth was much more complicated than the fairytale……"So saying, I smile wryly.For someone of my capabilities, combining this world's various legends into a believable struggle in the shadows scenario is a piece of cake."Right before he died, Diabolos casted a curse on the three heroes. That is called the Curse of Diabolos.""The Curse of Diabolos? I've never heard of such a thing……""No, the Curse of Diabolos truly exists. But it is commonly known by another name – 'demon possession.' Indeed, it is exactly what you had been suffering from.""How could that be……"Alpha's eyes open wide in shock."The descendents of the heroes who defeated Diabolos will forever suffer from that curse. However, long ago, that Curse of Diabolos was treatable. Just as you were."The fact that Alpha's skin is now white and unblemished – as if she had never been afflicted with demon possession – is the greatest proof of what I'm saying.It's all a big, fat lie though."Demon possession is the proof of being a descendent of one of the heroes. As the children of those who had saved the world, they were valued, protected, thanked, and extolled. All in past tense though.""But now we are not thanked. Rather, we are……"Alpha's face scrunches up, unable to continue her sentence."Someone had distorted history. Hiding the fact of it being the symbol of the heroes, hiding the method to treat the curse, and furthermore even renaming it as 'demon possession' and turning it into a target of scorn.""WHO?! Who would do something like that?""They are those who are plotting the resurrection of the demon Diabolos. Those suffering from the Curse of Diabolos are, without exception, those with high magic capabilities due to having heavily inherited the blood of the heroes. In other words, they are our precious military strength, and thus obstacles to Diabolos.""Which is why they call it demon possession and execute them? They're the lowest of the low!""Having been branded with the fabricated sin of demon possession, having been chased from your home and family, do you feel hatred?""I. Hate. Them. How can I not?""The Order of Diabolos. That is our enemy. They would never stand in the public stage. As such, we too must lurk in the shadows. We will lurk in the shadows, and we will hunt the shadows.""To possess that much influence even without appearing in the public stage…… In other words, it means this Order must have many members in very powerful positions, and that there are many people being manipulated by them without even knowing of their existence."I nod gravely."It will be a path filled with thorns and thistles. However, this is something that must be done. Will you lend me your strength?""If it is your wish, I am resolved to even offer my life. On top of which, this is my own wish as well. We shall succeed without fail."Alpha fixes her blue eyes on me and laughs with fearlessly. Her young and beautiful eyes are filled with resolve and determination.I mentally do a guts pose.Damn yea, this elf is hella gullible!Naturally, the Order of Diabolos does not exist, so no matter how hard she searches, there's no way she'd find anything. Every once in a while, we'll go take out some random bandit gang on suspicion of being a member of the Order. Or we'll jump in and interrupt a fight between some some protagonist-like people and say things like "The destruction of this world is nigh!" or "The resurrection of the demon is nigh!" before making a flashy exit. Or we can flashily show up on a battlefield and say "Oh ye foolish sheep who know not that you are being manipulated……" before taking everyone out. Ohhh, all the things that we can do! The sky's the limit!Oh right, as for the all-important name of our organization……"We shall be known as Shadow Garden…… We who lurk in the shadows and hunt the shadows……""Shadow Garden. What a wonderful name."Today, at this moment, Shadow Garden came to be. And at the same time, the enemy of this world, the Order of Diabolos was also born. I have taken one more step towards becoming a power in the shadows."Well, for now, let's just improve our magic control and swordsmanship. The bulk of the fighting I will take on, but I will assign you to deal with the small fries so you'll also have to become at least strong enough to handle that much.""I understand. The enemy is powerful, so we have to raise our own strength.""Yep, yep, exactly.""And we must also search out the other descendants of the heroes and safeguard them.""Um, yea, that too. In moderation."Playing as a power in the shadows with more people would indeed give it more of an organization feel, but we don't really need too many. To be honest, personally speaking I'm fine if it's just the two of us."Well, for the near future let's focus on getting stronger first."So saying, I bring up my wooden sword and parry Alpha's attack. She has made enormous progress after only a month of training.Her sense is great, and she has more than enough magic. Seems she'll be of quite some use.So I thought as I continued swinging my wooden sword underneath the moonlight.It has been about 3 years since the establishment of Shadow Garden. Alpha and I have both become 13 years old, and my older sister Claire is now 15. There is no particular meaning associated with the age 13, but that is not the case with the age 15. When the children of nobles reach 15, they have to attend a school in the royal capital for 3 years. Nee-san is pretty much the rising hope of the Kagenou baron family, so my mom is all pumped up with setting up the farewell party and all that. Yep, rising hope indeed.(T/N: 'Nee-san' is what the MC calls his older sister.)All that's fine and all. Really. But problem is, when it came day for her to actually set off for the capital, she up and disappeared. Thus the enormous tumult at the Kagenou house at the moment."When I came into the room, it was already like this."So says my father in a dandy voice. His face isn't too bad either."There is no sign of a struggle, but the window was indeed forced open from the outside. The fact that neither I nor Claire was alerted means the kidnapper very skilled indeed."My dandy dad places one hand on the windowsill and looks off into the distance. All that's missing from this picture is a whiskey glass in his hand.And hair……"So?"A chilling voice is directed at him."Very skilled, so there's no helping it? Is that what you're trying to say?"It's mom."No, no of course not. I was merely stating the facts……"So answers my dad as cold sweat rolls down his face."You STUPID BALDYYYYYY!!!!!!""Hiii, I'm sorry, I'm very sorry!!!"By the way, I'm air. Nothing is expected of me, and neither do I cause any trouble. That's the position in this family that I'm striving to maintain.But well, Nee-san was a pretty good person, so it's a bit of a pity. The crime happened at night when I was at the abandoned village, so there was nothing that I could have done either.I quietly listen to my parents' bickering and, at the first chance I get, return to my own room. I place my palms together in the direction that Nee-san had disappeared, then dive into my bed.Then."You may come out now.""Yes, my lord."Immediately, my curtains sway slightly, and a young girl wearing a black slime bodysuit steps out."Beta, huh.""Yes, my lord."Same as Alpha, she is also a young elf girl. But where Alpha has blond hair, Beta's is silver.She of the cat-like green eyes and a mole under her eye was the third person to join Shadow Garden. Even though I told Alpha "in moderation," but Alpha brings them in like stray cats or something so their numbers keep growing."Where's about Alpha?""Searching for traces of Claire-sama.""Fast reaction. You think Nee-san is still alive?""Likely so.""Can she be saved?""Possible, yes…… but might require Shadow-sama's help."Ah by the way, they're calling me 'Shadow.' Cus I'm the master of Shadow Garden, fufufu."Is that what Alpha said?""Yes, my lord. She said that since they have a hostage, it would be best to bring our full force.""Heeh~"To be frank, Alpha has gotten quite strong. The fact that even Alpha is asking for help must mean that someone of very significant power is involved."My blood boils……"I clench my fist while instantaneously releasing magic to create a small explosion.There's no particular meaning to it, but I like this kind of theatrics.I can hear Beta murmuring "As expected……" with surprise.As of late, I haven't been in lack of a sparring partner, what with Alpha and Beta and Delta and the crew, but something fresh is good every once in a while. Above all else, I want to play at being a power in the shadows, so this seems like a good opportunity."It's been a while since I last got serious……"Just like so, I've also gotten used to exuding the aura of a power hidden in the shadows.Also, lately Alpha and Beta have taken to fleshing out our setting even further, so it's been a blast."The criminal is, as expected, part of the Order of Diabolos. Even more, he is one of their upper echelons.""One of their echelons, huh. So why did they kidnap Nee-san?""They suspect her of being a Descendent of the Heroes.""Hmph, those sharp-eyed bastards……"So yea, like that.Furthermore, they've also been 'gathering research' and saying things like "As expected, your words were entirely correct……" and "About a thousand years ago, Diabolos' descendents……" and "From this stone monument we can glean clues that point to the existence of the Order of Diabolos……" and other similar such. I mean, I can't read ancient letters so how would I know? I bet Alpha can't really read them either, so she just lays out all these ancient-looking materials and whatnot of a similar general feeling in front of me, so that we can feel like we're making some headway in investigating the Order. I'm sure that must be it."Please take a look at these documents. These are the hideouts that we think Claire-sama might be held in, based on our latest intel."After saying that, Beta plonks a huge pile of paper on my table. Ok seriously, I have no idea what to do with all this. More than half of it is in an ancient language and the rest is filled with indecipherable mathematical equations or something. Damn, you guys have gotten good at making up this kind of stuff. I'll admit, you all have gotten even more pro at it than me.While ignoring Beta's 'explanations,' I take out a throwing knife and throw it at the map on the wall.Thunk.With a dull sound, the knife pierces a certain point."There.""That place? What is there?""That's where Nee-san is.""But that place, there's noth-…… no, wait, could it be……!"Beta hurriedly rummages through the materials as if she'd just realized something.Um, yeeaa, I just randomly threw that knife, alright?But wow your acting is good, Beta. I can see where this is going – you're going to tell me that there is a secret hideout at that location, aren't you?"In conclusion, after comparing various sources, it seems that there is indeed a high possibility that there is a secret hideout at the location that Shadow-sama just pointed out."Called it."But still, to read through this enormous amount of materials in a split second and even deduce the location of a hidden hideout…… as expected of Shadow-sama.""You still lack training, Beta.""I shall double my diligence."Seriously, she's good. Even though I know it's acting, but I can still feel the emotions that she's conveying. You've got all the important points down pat, Beta."I shall inform Alpha-sama at once. Will we move tonight?""Mm."Beta bows, then takes her leave. Her eyes are glittering and all, such that I can totally feel the respect and whatnot. Cheers to her Academy-level acting.A man was walking alone through a dark underground tunnel.Age in the mid-thirties. A well-trained body and sharp eyes. Swept back grey hair.His footsteps stopped as he reached the end of the tunnel. In front of him was a door protected by 2 soldiers."Is the Kagenou girl inside?""Yes, Olba-sama."The soldier that he addressed saluted, then unlocked the door."Sir, please mind yourself in there. Though restrained, she is extremely aggressive.""Hmph, who do you think I am?""!! I'm very sorry, sir!"Olba opened the door then walked in.The room beyond was an underground stone-walled jail. A single girl was affixed to the wall with with magic-sealing chains."You must be Claire Kagenou."At Olba's voice, the girl called Claire raised her head.She was a very beautiful girl. As she had been kidnapped while sleeping, she was still wearing a thin negligee that could not hide her full breasts nor her luscious thighs. With her silk-like black hair cut in a straight line behind her back, the girl glared up at Olba with with strong-willed eyes."I've seen your face at the royal capital before. If I remember correctly, you are Viscount Olba, are you not?""Hou, you were with the Imperial Guards previously…… Ah, no, it was at the tournament during the Festival of the God of War?""Festival of the God of War, heh. Oh yes, that time when Princess Iris cut you up every which way."Claire laughed in merriment."Hmph, it was within the limits of a match, and thus didn't mean anything. In a real fight, there's no way I'd lose to her.""Nothing would be different in a real fight, oh Viscount Olba who lost in the first round in the tournament.""Fool. You don't even know how much of an honor it is to simply just stand on the stage of that tournament, you ignorant girl."Olba glared back at Claire."I will be able to stand on that stage just 1 year later.""Too bad for you, you don't have a year left."The chains restricting Claire clinked.Immediately afterwards, her teeth snapped just barely short of Olba's neck.If Olba hadn't tilted his head that little bit, then his carotid artery might have been torn out right there and then."The one who can't live for one more year – will that truly be me? Or will it be…… you? Do you want to bet on it?""No need for the bet, Claire Kagenou."Olba's fist slammed into the chin beneath Claire's dauntless smile.She crashed onto the stone ground, but her strong eyes never left Olba.Olba lowered his fist, having felt less resistance on his fist than expected."You jumped backwards."Claire smiled dauntlessly."Was there a fly in the room?""Hmph, seems you're not just led around the nose by your large magic capacity.""I was taught that magic is not about amount, but control.""What a good father you have.""I've never learned a thing from that baldy. It was my little brother.""Brother……?""My impertinent little brother. Every time we fight, I'd win. But I'm always learning from my little brother's sword. But he never learns anything from my sword. That's why I pick on him everyday."So said Claire in an impish tone."What a pitiful younger brother. That would make me an ally of justice who saved him from his tyrannical older sister. Anyways, that's enough pointless banter."Olba cleared his throat and fixed his gaze on Claire."Claire Kagenou. As of late, have you felt anything strange with your body? For example, your control over your magic slipping, or your health being unstable, or a sharp pain whenever you try to use magic, or black rot appearing on parts of your body? Do any of those symptoms bring anything to mind?""After going to all the trouble of kidnapping me, what you wanted to do was to play doctor?"The edge of Claire's glossy lips raised into a sneer."I, too, previously had a daughter. I do not wish to employ more violent means. Answering my questions honestly would lead to the best outcome for us both.""Ooo, is that a threat? Unfortunately, I have a personality that makes me want to rebel when threatened. Even if my head understands that it would not be logical to do.""So you mean to say that you have no intention to cooperate?""I wonder~"Olba and Claire glared at each other.The one who broke the silence first was Caire."Very well. It's nothing big anyways, so I'll tell you. You mentioned instability with my body and magic, right? Now I'm perfectly fine, aside from these chains.""'Now'?""Yes, 'now.' It was about a year ago when I had those symptoms that you listed.""You mean to say that you no longer have them? They went away by themselves?"To Olba's knowledge, there's never been a case of 'that' being healed."Hmm, I didn't really do anything spe-…… oh right, my little brother had me do something he called 'stretches'? I don't really know the details, but he asked me to practice it, and before I knew it my body returned to being in top condition.""'Stretches'? Never heard of it…… But the fact that you had the symptoms before means that there's no mistake, you are indeed compatible.""Compatible? With what?""There's no need for you to know. You'll be broken before long anyways. Ahh, I'll need to investigate your brother too then……"Something suddenly smashed into Olba's nose, cutting off his words."Guh?"Olba retreated to the door, glaring at Claire while suppressing his nosebleed."Claire Kagenou, you bitch……!"All four of her limbs were supposedly restricted, but for some reason her left arm is currently hanging free, with blood dripping down from it."You scraped off your own flesh and dislocated your finger……?!"The chains binding her were not normal chains, but magic-sealing chains. In other words, Claire had used pure brute strength to chafe off her own skin, crush her finger bones, and thus free her arm from the chain. That's how she was able to hit Olba.Olba was greatly shocked at that truth."If something happens to him, I will never forgive you! I will kill you, your loved ones, your family, your friends, and everyone else that means anything to you……!?"Olba's full power punch landed on Claire's stomach. Bound in place by the magic-sealing chains, Claire had no way to evade to evade Olba's magic-strengthened blow."You brat!"Olba spat on Claire's crumpled body.The blood that flowed from Claire's left hand was pooling together into a dark red stain on the ground."No matter. You should now understand……"So muttering, Olba reached towards that blood. But right at that moment, a soldier breathlessly rushed into the room."Olba-sama, it's terrible! We have intruders!""Intruders?! How many?!""Unknown! They seem to be few in numbers, but we are being completely run over!""Kuh, very well, I'll go out myself! You lot fall back and set up a defensive formation!"After clicking his tongue once, Olba turned around.
